<br><br>
If you already have Python (3.7.x or newer) and PgZero installed:
  - You can simply run rungame.bat and you should be good to go!

In case you do not have Python or PgZero installed:
  - You can download Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads
    - It's important that you do mark the "Add Python to PATH" checbox, it will save you time!
      
  - Then you can install PgZero by opening the command prompt and inserting:
    pip install pgzero
    
If the .bat by chance is not working for you, try navigating via cmd to the directory on wich the .py file, as well as the images, sounds and music folders are located, then running the command: pgzrun desertadventure.py

- The game WILL NOT WORK if the .py file is not on the same directory as the asset folders, be sure that it is!
