# DesertAdventure
A PgZero platformer demonstration, made with care as a Python test entry!

-/- HOW TO RUN -/-

- If you already have Python (3.7.x or newer) and PgZero installed:
  You can simply run rungame.bat and you should be good to go!

- In case you do not have Python or PgZero installed:
  You can download Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads
    It's important that you do mark the "Add Python to PATH" checbox, it will save you time!
  
  Then you can install PgZero by opening the command prompt and inserting:
    pip install pgzero

  And we are done!

- If the .bat by chance is not working for you, try:
    Navigating via cmd to the directory on wich the .py file, as well as the images, sounds and music are located;
    running the command:
      pgzrun desertadventure.py
